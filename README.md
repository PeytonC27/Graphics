# My SDL2 Graphics Renderer

This is a project that uses SDL2 and C++ to render 3D objects. In its current state, it is capable of:
- Rendering a Cube/Rectangular Prism
- Rotating/Translating shapes
- Rendering with a set depth

Future Plans:
- More shapes to create
- Perspective view
- Export to `.obj` file
